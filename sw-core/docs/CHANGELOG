=over 2

=item - Created a Makefile.PL to create well-formed CPAN compliant 
distributions (Philippe)

=item - Moved the SW::Config files which contained site specific 
info out of the framework and into the /conf folder (make sure 
you update your sw-perl-startup.pl to reflect this)  (Scott)

=item - GroupManager implemented, let's the user create/delete/edit 
groups as well as invite others into the groups.   
 C<SW::App::GroupManager> (Fred)

=item - Re-organized the cvs and name spaces a bit.  Moved the 
apps into the C<SW::App::whatever> namespace to avoid conflicts.   
Details to go up on the CVS page (Scott & Philippe)

=item - Created SW::Handler to replace the hacked up Apache::Registry 
we were using.  Details on how this works will be added to the 
reference docs on the web site.  Requires changes to 
C<smartworker.conf>  (Philippe Chiasson)

=item - fixed SW::Util::Prep so it ingores leading spaces in the 
#SW directives  (Scott)

C<SW::Data - getStorage('key')	 >

(Scott)


=item - defined consistent naming conventions for GUIElement 
properties (see naming_conventions in the /docs dir and the soon 
to be started reference manual )  (JF Brousseau)
NOTE:  This may break your apps :-(  in particular -target 
attributes on all but the LinkExternal Object now become -signal

=item - major overhaul of the app writing how-to   (Fred H)
